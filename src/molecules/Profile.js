                Iâ€™ ve worked across the stack in Javascript, from front-end technologies like React, Redux, and Angular, to server - side Node / Express servers, MySql databases, and RESTful APIs. I have a passion
                for engineering solutions to smart and satisfying user experiences.  I enjoy optimizing and tinkering with applications until they are just right.

                I have a background in art and believe it formed the foundation from which I have built strong engineering skills, and also effectively closes the gap that sometimes exists between designers and engineers.
