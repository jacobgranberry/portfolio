                Iâ€™ ve worked across the stack in Javascript, from front-end technologies like React, Redux, and Angular, to server - side Node / Express servers, MySql databases, and RESTful APIs. I have a passion
                for engineering solutions to smart and satisfying user experiences.  I enjoy optimizing and tinkering with applications until they are just right.

                I have a background in art and believe it formed the foundation from which I have built strong engineering skills, and also effectively closes the gap that sometimes exists between designers and engineers.

                I also founded a popular fan project called WesterosCraft, a Minecraft server building the world of Game of Thrones. It has been in numerous publications, holds a Guinness World Record, exhibited in museums, and continues to impress and innovate in the community-driven video game space. When I'm not managing that, I'm reading a good book, walking the dogs with my wife or drinking a good beer.
